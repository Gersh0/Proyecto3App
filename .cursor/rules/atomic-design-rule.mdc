# Atomic Design
 
## Overview
The components directory follows atomic design principles, organizing reusable UI elements in a hierarchical structure from simple to complex components.
 
## Component Organization
 
### `/components/atomic-design`
This folder contains all reusable interface elements that can be used throughout the application. A component is considered reusable if it is used in two or more pages.
 
#### Atoms
- The simplest, indivisible UI elements
- Cannot be broken down further
- Examples: buttons, inputs, labels
- **Shadcn**: A collection of predefined components that we aim to reuse across all our projects
 
#### Molecules
- Components created from multiple atoms
- Examples: card with a button
- Should be focused on a single responsibility
 
#### Organisms
- Combinations of multiple molecules and/or atoms
- More complex than molecules
- Examples: forms, complex UI sections
- This directory contains:
  - **Autoform**: Components for generating forms
  - **Generic table**: Reusable table components
  
#### Templates
- Page structures that can be reused
- Define the layout and organization of content
- Can be adapted for different pages while maintaining consistent structure
 
### `/app`
- Contains page-specific components that aren't reusable
- Each folder corresponds to an application flow
- Folders and files should be named in English
- Files in this directory are entry points and should be kept minimal
 
### `/components/rbac`
- Contains components for role-based access control
- Manages access based on user roles in the frontend
 
## Best Practices
- Keep components as focused and simple as possible
- Respect the component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates)
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Document complex components
- Maintain consistent naming and styling across all components
- Components should be properly typed with TypeScript
- Use kebab-case for all component file names
